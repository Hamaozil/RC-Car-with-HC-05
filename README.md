# RC Car with HC 05
  In this repository, I will show you how I made an RC car with a Bluetooth (HC-05) module.

# What is RC car with HC-05?
The RC Car is a typical vehicle with wheels that can be operated using either a joystick or a mobile app. 
 To enable wireless connectivity, the car must be equipped with a Bluetooth module or a similar device. 
Personally, I use the HC-05 Bluetooth Module, which serves as both a master and a slave.
